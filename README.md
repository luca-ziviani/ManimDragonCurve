# Manim code for the Dragon Curve
In this repo I propose a simple code for computing and plotting the Dragon Curve with the Manim library.

The curve is constructed through an L-system, see the definition at the Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

See the documentation for Manim at the webpage [https://www.manim.community/](https://www.manim.community/).
